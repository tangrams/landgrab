 Polygon – a Python package for handling 2D-polygons
=====================================================

Introduction
============

Polygon is a python package that handles polygonal shapes in 2D. It contains 
Python bindings for gpc, the excellent General Polygon Clipping Library by 
Alan Murta and some extensions written in C and pure Python. With Polygon you 
may handle complex polygonal shapes in Python in a very intuitive way. Polygons 
are simple Python objects, clipping operations are bound to standard operators 
like +, -, \|, & and ^. TriStrips can be constructed from Polygons with a 
single statement. Functions to compute the area, center point, convex hull,
point containment and much more are included. This package was already used to
process shapes with more than one million points!

:Status:
    Should be almost stable now, but there may be memory leaks. Malformed 
    files and illegal contours may crash the library and your running Python 
    interpreter! Use Polygon at your own risk or don't use it at all!

    * gpc: http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~toby/alan/software/

gpc is included in Polygon, you don't need to download it separately. I made 
two small changes to gpc:

1.  fixed warnings regarding a printf format string and 
2.  made GPC_EPSILON adjustable, this may slow down the clipping a little bit. 

The author of gpc (Alan Murta) is not responsible for this distribution! The 
wrapping and extension code is free software, but the core gpc library is free 
for non-commercial usage only. The author says:

    GPC is free for non-commercial use only. We invite non-commercial users 
    to make a voluntary donation towards the upkeep of GPC.
    If you wish to use GPC in support of a commercial product, you must obtain 
    an official GPC Commercial Use Licence from The University of Manchester.

Please respect this statement and contact the author (see gpc homepage) if you 
wish to use this software in commercial projects!

Platforms and Dependencies
--------------------------
There are two branches of the package. Versions 2.0.x works with python versions
2.x starting with python 2.5. Versions 3.0.x needs python 3.x. Both versions
have almost identical features and APIs. You need a python interpreter from
python.org, jython or ironpython will not work.

Polygon should work with recent versions of Linux, MacOS X and Windows
systems. Not all combinations of operating system, python version and compiler
could be tested.

Installation
============

Binaries
--------
Please choose a binary distribution from the homepage that fits your operating 
system and python version. For a Linux system you should compile the package 
by yourself (see below).

From Source
-----------
Polygon uses the python distutils package. Please edit setup.py and adjust the 
values on top of the file. Run the command ``python setup.py install`` to 
compile and install the module. Make sure you have write permissions in pythons 
site-packages directory or use the --prefix or --home options!

You need a C-compiler to install Polygon from source. While this is usually no 
problem on Linux, it may be difficult to compile the module on Windows. I 
strongly recommend using the python-xy distribution which includes the free 
C-compiler MinGW32.

Basic Example
=============

>>> import Polygon, Polygon.IO
>>> q = Polygon.Polygon(((0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (10.0, 5.0), (0.0, 5.0)))
>>> t = Polygon.Polygon(((1.0, 1.0), (3.0, 1.0), (2.0, 3.0)))
>>> a = q - t  # gives a rectangle with a triangular hole
>>> Polygon.IO.writeSVG('test.svg', (a,))

Contents and Usage
==================
The package consists of the main module (imported from cPolygon) and 
additional modules IO, Shapes and Utils.

Main module: the Polygon Class
------------------------------
The main module contains the following symbols:

Polygon(\|arg):
    the class for Polygon objects, see below
setDataStyle(style):
    set data style, one of STYLE_TUPLE, STYLE_LIST or STYLE_NUMPY
setTolerance(tol):
    set tolerance for detection of coincident nodes
getTolerance():
    get tolerance for detection of coincident nodes
Error:
    the exception raised when methods or operations fail
withNumPy:
    flag showing if the support for NumPy is enabled
STYLE_TUPLE, STYLE_LIST, STYLE_ARRAY:
    data style constants to be used with setDataStyle
__version__, __author__, __license__:
    variables to hold meta information on the package

In this library a polygon object is a sequence of contours. A contour (a.k.a 
point list) is an ordered sequence of nodes (points) while a point is a 
2-sequence of floats (x and y coordinates). If support for NumPy is enabled, 
a point list may be an array with the shape (i, 2) with i being the number of 
points.

A Polygon object may contain any number of  normal contours (outline) and 
contours which describe a hole. Every contour has an associated 0/1 flag to 
specify a hole. The length of a Polygon object is the number of contours. You 
may access single contours with indexing ([]), slicing is not (yet) supported.
You can't delete or change existing contours or single points of a polygon by 
assigning values. Please change the point lists before you apply them to a 
Polygon object instead.

Operations on Polygon Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(p and q are polygons)

:p & q:
    intersection: a polygon with the area that is covered by both p and q
:p \| q:
    union: a polygon containing the area that is covered by p or q or both
:p - q:
    difference: a polygon with the area of p that is not covered by q
:p + q:
    sum: same as union
:p ^ q:
    xor: a polygon with the area that is covered by exactly one of p and q
:len(p):
    number of contours
:p[i]:
    contour with index i, the same as p.contour(i), slicing is not yet 
    supported
:bool(p):
    logical value is true, if there are any contours in p (contours may be 
    empty!)

Polygon(\|arg)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Constructor: Create a new Polygon  object. Files must contain data in gpc 
polygon format. If arg is another polygon, a copy is returned.

:Arguments:
    - a filename string and an optional holeflag (see read() and write()), 
    - or a readable file object (version 2.0.x only)
    - or a pointlist (sequence of 2-sequences) 
    - or another polygon object
:Returns:
    Polygon object

p.addContour(c \|, hole=0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Add a contour (outline or hole).

:Arguments:
    - c: pointlist (sequence of 2-tuples)
    - optional hole: bool
:Returns:
    None

p.contour(i)
~~~~~~~~~~~~
gives the contour with index i (the same as p[i])

:Arguments:
    - i: integer
:Returns:
    a contour
    
p.isHole(\|i)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Returns the hole flag of a single contour (when called with index argument) or 
a list  of all flags when called without arguments.

:Arguments:
    - optional i: integer
:Returns:
    bool or list of bools

p.isSolid(\|i)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Returns the inverted hole flag of a single contour (when called with index 
argument) or a list  of all inverted flags when called without arguments.

:Arguments:
    - optional i: integer
:Returns:
    bool or list of bools

p.nPoints(\|i)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Returns the number of points of one contour or of the whole polygon. Is much 
faster than len(p[i]) or reduce(add, map(len, p))!

:Arguments:
    - optional i: integer
:Returns:
    an integer

p.read(file)
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Reads Polygon data from a file in gpc format. The file format has changed a 
while ago, hole flags can now be read and written (this is the default). Make 
sure you set the optional argument to False when reading files without this 
flag, otherwise the coordinates may not be correct!

:Arguments:
    - file: readable file object (version 2.0.x only) or filename string
    - optional holeflag: bool
:Returns:
    None

p.write(file)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Writes Polygon data to a file in gpc format. For the optional argument see 
above.

:Arguments:
    - file: writable file object (version 2.0.x only) or filename string
    - optional holeflag: bool
:Returns:
    None

p.simplify()
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Try to simplify Polygon. It's possible to add overlapping contours or holes 
which are outside of other contours. This may result in wrong calculations of 
the area, center point, bounding box or other values. Call this method to 
make sure the Polygon is in a good shape. The method first adds all contours 
with a hole flag of 0, then substracts all holes and replaces  the original 
Polygon with the result.

:Arguments:
    None
:Returns:
    None

p.area(\|i)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Calculates the area of one contour (when called with index) or of the whole 
polygon. All values are positive! The polygon area is the sum of areas of all 
solid contours minus the sum of all areas of holes.

:Arguments:
    - optional i: integer
:Returns:
    a float 

p.center(\|i)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Calculates the center of gravity of one contour (when called with index) or of 
the whole Polygon. The center may  be outside the contours or inside holes. 
This is not the center of the bounding box!

:Arguments:
    - optional i: integer
:Returns:
    a 2-tuple containing x and y float values

p.orientation(\|i)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Calculates the orientation of one contour (when called with index) or of all 
contours. There's no default orientation, holes are defined by the hole flag, 
not by the orientation!

:Arguments:
    - optional i: integer
:Returns:
    single integer or list of integers: 1 for ccw,  -1 for cw, 0 for invalid 
    contour. 

p.isInside(x, y \|, i)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Point containment test: returns logical containment value for a single 
contour (when called with index) or of the whole Polygon. If point is exactly 
on the border, the value may be True or False, sorry!

:Arguments:
    - x: float
    - y: float
    - optional i: integer
:Returns:
    bool

p.covers(q)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Tests if the polygon completely covers the other polygon q. At first the 
bounding boxes are tested for obvious cases and then an optional clipping is 
performed.

:Arguments:
    - p: Polygon
:Returns:
    bool

p.overlaps(q)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tests if the polygon overlaps the other polygon q. At first the bounding boxes 
are tested for obvious cases and then an optional clipping is performed.

:Arguments:
    - p: Polygon
:Returns:
    bool

p.boundingBox(\|i)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Calculates the bounding box  of one contour (when called with index) or of the 
whole polygon. In the latter case the data is cached and used for following 
calls and internal calculations. The data will be recalculated automatically 
when this method is called after the polygon has changed.

:Arguments:
    - optional i: integer
:Returns:
    tuple of four floats: xmin, xmax, ymin and ymax


p.aspectRatio(\|i)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Returns the aspect ratio (ymax-ymin) / (xmax-xmin) of the bounding box of one 
contour (when called with index) or of the whole polygon.

:Arguments:
    - optional i: integer
:Returns:
    float

p.scale(xs, ys \|, xc, yc)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Scales the polygon by multiplying with xs and ys around the center point. If 
no center is given the center point of the bounding box is used, which will 
not be changed by this operation.

:Arguments:
    - xs: float
    - ys: float
    - optional xc: float
    - optional yc: float
:Returns:
    None

p.shift(xs, ys)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Shifts the polygon by adding xs and ys.

:Arguments:
    - xs: float
    - ys float
:Returns:
    None

p.rotate(a \|, xc, yc)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rotates the polygon by angle a around center point in ccw direction. If no 
center is given the center point of the bounding box is used.

:Arguments:
    - a: float
    - optional xc: float
    - optional yc: float
:Returns:
    None
    
p.warpToBox(x0, x1, y0, y1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Scales and shifts the polygon to fit into the bounding box specified by x0, 
x1, y0 and y1. Make sure: x0 < x1 and y0 < y1!

:Arguments:
    - x0: float
    - x1: float
    - y0: float
    - y1: float
:Returns:
    None
    
p.flip(\|x)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Flips polygon in x direction. If a value for x is not given, the center of the 
bounding box is used.

:Arguments:
    - optional x: float
:Returns:
    None

p.flop(\|y)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Flips polygon in y direction. If a value for y is not given, the center of the 
bounding box is used.

:Arguments:
    - optional y: float
:Returns:
    None

p.cloneContour(i\|, xs, ys)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clones the contour i, returns index of clone, optionally shifts clone by xs 
and ys.

:Arguments:
    - i: integer
    - optional xs: float
    - optional ys: float
:Returns:
    integer

p.triStrip()
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Returns a list of tristrips describing the Polygon area. A tristrip is a list of 
triangles. The sum of all triangles fill the tristrip area. The triangles 
are usually not in a good shape for FEM methods!

Each strip stores triangle data by an memory-efficient method. A strip is a 
tuple containing points (2-tuples). The first three items of the tuple belong 
to the first triangle. The second, third and fourth item are the corners of 
the second triangle. Item number three, four and five are the corners of the 
third triangle, (...you may guess the rest!). The number of triangles in a 
strip is the number of points minus 2.

:Arguments:
    None 
:Returns:
    list of tuples of 2-tuples


p.sample(rng)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Returns a random sample somewhere within the polygon.

:Arguments:
    - rng: Random number generator, a function or method taking 0 arguments, that returns a float [0.0..1.0] (e.g., python's random.random).
:Returns:
    random point in the polygon as a 2-tuple

Module Polygon.IO
-----------------
This module provides functions for reading and writing Polygons in different
formats.

encodeBinary(p)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Encode Polygon p to a binary string. The binary string will be in a standard 
format with network byte order and should be rather machine independant. 
There's no redundancy in the string, any damage will make the hole polygon 
information unusable.

:Arguments:
    - p: Polygon
:Returns:
    string

decodeBinary(s)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create Polygon from a binary string created with encodeBinary(). If the string 
is not valid, the whole thing may break!

:Arguments:
    - s: string
:Returns:
    new Polygon


The following write-methods will accept different argument types for the 
output. If ofile is None, the method will create and return a StringIO-object. 
If ofile is a string, a file with that name will be created. If ofile is a 
file, it will be used for writing.

The following read-methods will accept different argument types for the 
output. An file or StringIO object will be used directly. If the argument is a 
string, the function tries to read a file with that name. If it fails, it 
will evaluate the string directly.

Module Polygon.Utils
--------------------
This Module contains several utility functions.

fillHoles(p)
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Returns the polygon p without any holes.

:Arguments:
    - p: Polygon
:Returns:
    new Polygon
    
pointList(p)
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Returns a list of all points of p.

:Arguments:
    - p: Polygon
:Returns:
    list of points
    
convexHull(p)

:Returns:
    new Polygon

tile(p, x=[], y=[] \|, bb=None)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Returns a list of polygons which are tiles of p splitted at the border values 
specified in x and y. If you already know the bounding box of p, you may give 
it as argument bb (4-tuple) to speed up the calculation.

:Arguments:
    - p: Polygon
    - x: list of floats
    - y: list of floats
    - optional bb: tuple of 4 floats
:Returns:
    list of new Polygons

tileEqual(p, nx=1, ny=1 \|, bb=None)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
works like tile(), but splits into nx and ny parts.

:Arguments:
    - p: Polygon
    - nx: integer
    - ny: integer
    - optional bb: tuple of 4 floats
:Returns:
    list of new Polygons

warpToOrigin(p)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Shifts lower left corner of the bounding box to origin.

:Arguments:
    - p: Polygon
:Returns:
    None

centerAroundOrigin(p)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Shifts the center of the bounding box to origin.

:Arguments:
    - p: Polygon
:Returns:
    None

prunePoints(p)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Returns a new Polygon which has exactly the same shape as p, but unneeded 
points are removed. The new Polygon has no double points or points that are 
exactly on a straight line.

:Arguments:
    - p: Polygon
:Returns:
    new Polygon

reducePoints(cont, n)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Remove points of the contour 'cont', return a new contour with 'n' points.
*Very simple* approach to reduce the number of points of a contour. Each point 
gets an associated 'value of importance' which is the product of the lengths 
and absolute angle of the left and right vertex. The points are sorted by this 
value and the n most important points are returned. This method may give 
*very* bad results for some contours like symmetric figures. It may even 
produce self-intersecting contours which are not valid to process with 
this module.

:Arguments:
    - contour: list of points
:Returns:
    new list of points

cloneGrid(poly, con, xl, yl, xstep, ystep)

    - yl: integer
    - xstep: float
    - ystep: float
:Returns:
    new Polygon

tileBSP(p)
~~~~~~~~~~
This generator function returns tiles of a polygon. It will be much more 
efficient for larger polygons and a large number of tiles than the original 
tile() function. For a discussion see:
http://dr-josiah.blogspot.com/2010/08/binary-space-partitions-and-you.html

:Arguments:
    - p: Polygon
:Returns:
    tiles of the Polygon p on the integer grid

:Returns:
    - contours: number of contours
    - holes: number of holes (if contained)
    - points: total number of points
    - withHoles: file contains hole-flags
