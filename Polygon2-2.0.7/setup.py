Polygon is a python package that handles polygonal shapes in 2D. It contains 
Python bindings for gpc, the excellent General Polygon Clipping Library by 
Alan Murta and some extensions written in C and pure Python. With Polygon you 
may handle complex polygonal shapes in Python in a very intuitive way. Polygons 
are simple Python objects, clipping operations are bound to standard operators 
like +, -, \|, & and ^. TriStrips can be constructed from Polygons with a 
single statement. Functions to compute the area, center point, convex hull,
point containment and much more are included. This package was already used to
process shapes with more than one million points!

The gpc homepage is located at http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~toby/alan/software/ .

The wrapping and extension code is free software, but the core gpc library is
free for non-commercial usage only. The author says:

    GPC is free for non-commercial use only. We invite non-commercial users 
    to make a voluntary donation towards the upkeep of GPC.
